## Welcome!

Please use the navigation bar to the left to browse our cohort's *living syllabus/textbook*.

## Living link to gitbook

This book changes and is updated as the course goes on. That's why we call it a "living link".

You can __[access the GitBook here](https://billpatrianakos.gitbooks.io/wdi-bandits/content/)__. In it you'll find important course notes, cheat sheets, homework assignments, and a ton of information that'll let you spend less time taking notes and more time to experiment and play.

### A word on note taking

If you're going to take notes, don't take notes on commands or code. Take notes about concepts. We've already done most of the note-taking work for you so be sure not to reinvent the wheel. We might already have the info you wanted to take down as a note here in the GitBook anyway.

## Your Instructors

Your class has two co-instructors whose expertise perfectly complement each other.
