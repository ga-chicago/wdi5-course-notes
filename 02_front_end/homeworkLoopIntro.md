## HomeWork

1. Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

2.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

3.  Write a function named assignGrade that:
takes 1 argument, a number score.
returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

4.  Check the results of assignGrade function from the previous exercise for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc. 

5.  Make a pull Request to the homework repo.

6. explore something, maybe canvas, maybe velocity.js, tween.js, random codepens.
