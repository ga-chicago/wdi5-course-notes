```ruby
#inheritance through space ships!

class SaturnV
  def initialize
    @name = 'Saturn V'
    @fuel = 'liquid hydrogen'
    @mission = 'go to the moon'
  end

  def take_off
    return "We're taking off! YAY!"
  end

  def to_s
    return @name + " has a mission to " + @mission
  end
end

class SLS < SaturnV
  def initialize
    @name = 'SLS'
    @fuel = 'liquid hydrogen'
    @mission = ' to make it to Mars and Europa'
  end
end

class Enterprise < SLS
  def initialize
    @name = 'Starship enterprise'
    @mission = 'to boldly go where no man has gone before'
