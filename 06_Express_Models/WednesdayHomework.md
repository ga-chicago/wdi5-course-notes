## Wednesday Homework

In the application you were working in yesterday, create a 
seperate controller called users.  In this controller create
two get routes, and two post routes. 

Create a form that submits to a post route and 
console.log that information (who sends the form, client? Server? Where am I?)

Ask yourself while your doing this, is this the client or Server? DO IT!!!!!!!!

Create an ajax call to post some data to the other Post route,
and console.log that information.  

Ask yourself what defines the starting route of the routes in a controller?
