### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

##### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!
