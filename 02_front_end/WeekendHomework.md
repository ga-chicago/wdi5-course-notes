## Weekend Homework 

The homework this weekend is challenging, but a really great excercise to learn
how to manipulate the dom.  

Take this step by step and if you are getting errors console.log each part
You will download this zip file to go through the fellowship.  The directions 
are in the readme, and you will write your javascript in the js file.

Move these files to your homework repo, and submit a pull request when you are
finished.
