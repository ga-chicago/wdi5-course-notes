# Orientation

> What are the basics of this course? The answers lie here.

## Graduating

In order to graduate you must complete the following:

1. Complete 80% of the assigned homework
2. Complete all assigned projects (during project weeks)
3. Have no more than 3 unexcused absences (excused absences don't count toward this)

## Tools

You must have some basic tools to complete this course. You'll need:

- A computer running a somewhat recent version of OS X (v10.6 or later). Linux is allowed but you need to inform us first
- Install a text editor. Either Sublime Text or Atom. If your computer is older you'll likely want Sublime Text as it has better performance on all systems.
- The install fest tools. We'll install this software together on day 1 of class

You can [find the Installfest instructions here](chapter2.md) in case you missed it or want to take a closer look at how we set up your system to work as a developer.


## Office Hours

Your instructors will hold office hours each day from 4-6pm. If you feel you need extra help, have an issue, or questions you can sign up for a 20 minute time slot with either Bill or Jim. Two days a week we'll have open office hours where we'll stick around after class and help people on a first-come-first-served basis. *Please note: We may ask you to sign up for office hours on any given day if we feel you need extra practice or are struggling with a topic*.
