# Week 3 Weekend Homework

This weekend you'll have 2 parts for the homework.

## Part 1: Fellowship: jQuery Version

Your job is to complete the Fellowship homework you did using vanilla JavaScript except this time you'll be using jQuery instead.

This will require you to check out the jQuery API documentation at times.

[Download the project from GitHub](https://github.com/ga-chicago/fellowship/archive/master.zip) and then move it into this weeks's directory and rename the folder after yourself (i.e. `bill_patrianakos`).

Follow the instructions in the project folder to complete the homework.

## Part 2: Project 1 Planning

See the GitBook for details on the project as a whole. It is a game. Over this weekend, outline your plan for the game and come up with some wireframes and think about how you will implement it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The only deliverables for this part of the project due Monday are your written plans and any wireframes (or other assets) you'll need to describe the project. 

__You do not need to turn this in in this homework repository! We will speak with each of you individually and go over these plans and wireframes during one on one time Monday at the end of the day.__

Once we approve your game, you'll have the rest of the week to build it and will present the completed project on Friday 24th.
